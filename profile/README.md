## AIML4OS Implementation

One-stop-shop for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Official Statistics Project (AIML4OS) is an ESSnet collaborative project involving 16 countries, started on 1 April 2024 and will last 4 years.
The overall aim is to develop a ‘One Stop Shop’ for AI and ML in official statistics; that is, a platform which provides a single entry point for ESS staff to access a coherent set of capabilities for implementing AI/ML based solutions. This will provide them with tailored guidance and assistance in deploying AI/ML solutions within adequate methodological and implementation frameworks.  The project is developed through 13 WPs, 6 supporting implementation and 7 dedicated to use cases. 
The knowledge and the framework realised and use cases experiences developed by the Consortium will allow them to use AI/ML to enable the development of more efficient and effective ways to deliver growing demand on official statistics.
